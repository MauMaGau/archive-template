CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS

WELCOME! Last Viewpoint I refrained from mentioning
new members, but now I think I can honestly say that
I hope you like us and that you will enjoy being one
of the Group. Come hostelling when you can; you are
always welcome.

The Group programme is planned at Committee meetings,
held once a month on the first Thursday of each month.
If you have any ideas, criticism or are just interested,
come along. Visitors are welcome as long as they bring
a cup for tea at half-time. Just recently we have had
some changes in the Social Programme on Tuesdays, but
these things happen. Trevor being ill did not help.
The answer to the problem is to try and support the
programme by offering to help if you can. Let's have
a little quiet during announcements please — it makes
things a lot easier.

Pete Robertson will soon require help in running the
Weald Walkers Wander. This rally has now become a
real success because of its unusual flavour. Many
local Groups and individuals enter and this event can
be great fun for both marshals and entrants. Want to
help? — see Pete.

Just one point about hostelling. Please think of others.
especially at bed time. Not too much noise after lights
out please or the Group will get a bad name. I know this
applies to me as well as anybody, so therefore please
pretend that I am wearing sackcloth and ashes. On a
serious note then, let's cut out the excessive antics at
hostels.

So ends the second Epistle,
Bone
